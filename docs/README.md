# What is fhEVM ecosystem?

## fhevmjs

fhevmjs is a javscript library that enables developers to interact with blockchains using Zama's cutting-edge technology based on TFHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus). This library provides a seamless integration of TFHE encryption capabilities into web3 applications, allowing for secure and private interactions with smart contracts.

## Solidity library

The Solidity library we introduce is a powerful tool that empowers developers to manipulate encrypted data using TFHE within smart contracts. With this library, developers can perform computations over encrypted data, such as addition, multiplication, comparison and more, while maintaining the confidentiality of the underlying information.
